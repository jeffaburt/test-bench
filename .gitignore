# See http://help.github.com/ignore-files/ for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global

# Ignore my gemset
.rvmrc
# Ignore bundler config
/.bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/db/*.sqlite3

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*.log
/tmp

# Uncomment the following line to prevent the parse credentials from making it into source control (aka publicly available). Since this project is just small scale and for a school project, we are taking the simple route and including this.
# /config/parse_resource.yml
